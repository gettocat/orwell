* Ability to place in the block any random structured data (commands to the database).
* Support of voting (module democracy),
* Built-in domain system (based on difference #1), which allows creating a mnemonic alias for a database or any unique address.
For example oZmpGpF9QFBhqksZWqRpnUv95k7pdiRDrc -> nanocat
